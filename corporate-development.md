## Pointers

1.	Pull code often (several times a day if possible).
    * Pulling often will help prevent merge conflicts because you will not start modifying code that someone else has already modified. 
    * It is also good to review the new changes so you know what changed and see if there is anything you can learn from the changes someone else made.
2.	Push code often (at least once a day) 
    * This will help with preventing large merge conflicts
    * This will help others know what you are working on (and if you have //TODO statements other might be able to give you advice if they review changes).
    * Also since you are not here every day this will allow for you to work in tandem with someone else … instead of sitting stagnate for several days.  
3.	Make a goal for the day. 
    * A goal (task) should be able to be accomplished in one day. 
    * If something is too large for one day try to break it up in pieces that can be. 
4.	When still in development phase, code does not have to be 100% perfect before you commit it. 
    * Just try and make sure it does not fully break the application (this can be done by leaving your controller function but commenting out the calls to it).
    * Others can still give advice and pointers while it is being developed instead of all at the end. 
5.	Ask for help 
    * Yes, you should try and giver out problem by yourself (this is how most learning will be done)
    * Use Google, don’t be afraid.  Google is a tool to get your work done.  Unlike school you will not get in trouble for doing research online. 
    * (IMPORTANT) if your research is taking longer than an hour or two for one problem … ask for help from co-workers or senior associates. 
We don’t want issues to linger, we want to keep having progress in our work.
